# Voting Power Based on Historical Participation

## Project Description

This smart contract implements a dynamic voting system where users' voting power increases based on their historical participation in governance activities. The more a user participates in voting rounds, the more voting power they accumulate for future decisions. This incentivizes consistent engagement and rewards long-term community members with greater influence in governance matters.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a more equitable and engagement-driven governance system that:
- Rewards consistent participation over one-time large stakeholder influence
- Encourages long-term community building and engagement
- Creates a meritocratic voting system based on historical contribution
- Promotes democratic participation while giving experienced voters more influence

The system aims to balance democratic principles with the wisdom of experienced community members, creating a sustainable governance model that grows stronger over time.

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Historical Participation Tracking**: Records every vote cast by each participant
- **Dynamic Voting Power Calculation**: Automatically calculates voting power based on participation history
- **Progressive Reward System**: More participation equals greater voting influence
- **Round-based Voting**: Organized voting rounds with systematic tracking

### Technical Features
- **Automatic Registration**: New voters are automatically registered on first vote
- **Scalable Architecture**: Efficient storage and calculation of participation metrics
- **Transparent Scoring**: Clear algorithm for calculating voting power
- **Secure Implementation**: Built on Aptos framework with proper access controls

### User Benefits
- **Merit-based Influence**: Voting power earned through consistent participation
- **Community Building**: Incentivizes long-term engagement
- **Fair Representation**: Prevents manipulation by large one-time stakeholders
- **Growth Rewards**: Voting power increases with continued participation

## Future Scope

### Short-term Enhancements
- **Decay Mechanism**: Implement time-based decay for inactive voters
- **Category-specific Voting**: Different voting power for different proposal types
- **Delegation System**: Allow voters to delegate their earned voting power
- **Participation Streaks**: Bonus multipliers for consecutive voting rounds

### Medium-term Features
- **Advanced Metrics**: Include proposal creation and discussion participation
- **Governance Tokens**: Integration with token-based governance systems
- **Multi-chain Support**: Expand to other blockchain networks
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Real-time participation and voting power statistics

### Long-term Vision
- **AI-powered Governance**: Smart recommendation systems for voters
- **Cross-platform Integration**: Connect with external governance platforms
- **Reputation System**: Broader reputation metrics beyond just voting
- **Quadratic Voting**: Implement quadratic voting with participation weighting

### Research and Development
- **Game Theory Analysis**: Optimize incentive mechanisms
- **Sybil Resistance**: Advanced mechanisms to prevent fake accounts
- **Privacy Features**: Zero-knowledge proofs for private voting
- **Interoperability**: Cross-chain governance participation tracking
